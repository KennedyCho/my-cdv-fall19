# Radiolab: Right to be Forgotten

Listen to: Radiolab: Right to be Forgotten (WNYC, Apple Podcast, Spotify). It's a very nice podcast, enjoy it, and make your own thoughts about what's a fair or right use of data in the described situations.

## Forgive don't forget or forget don't forgive? 

The idea of forgiveness as mentioned within the podcast does bring about uncomfortable feelings of uncertainty. There are specific crimes and circumstances where an individual feels confident that another person deserves 'a second chance' at life. However, the idea that one can not be 'forgiven' by being forgotten seems at odds with the reality of what those who are requesting to have their info taken down are asking for. 

Another avenue of thought that could be interesting to explore would be the idea of adding to the narrative. This acts in contrast to the current solution which is to delete or edit public record information. An alternative would be to have an option to provide more information in order to construct a more rounded profile of an individual. The materials that are asked to be taken down are all pieces that provide negative information. Adding follow-up articles, interviews or exposés may frame the individual in question a better light and give more background to the present circumstances. Additionally, this tactic acts as a form of obfuscation which could simply bury the information just as the podcast narrator mentions (in the example of storing information in an attic).
