Visualize your data making use of group (<g>) elements
Your data points have multiple categories (names, values, labels etc.). Make each category affect a different aspect of a visual representation in a group.
Take this example by Giorgia Lupi. Each shape is a group of other shapes with attributes that represent different asspects of the data. She describes her logic on the back of the postcard. Create your own such logic for your data, and group shapes with different attributes into svg group elements.
