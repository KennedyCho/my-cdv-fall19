### What data did you choose to collect?
I chose to collect data pertaining to each instance where I looked into a reflective surface. This included the time, location, medium and whether or not I was with company.

### How did you collect it, what was the routine?
This dataset was collected using a google form where I inputed string data. It was subsequently exported into a JSON file. 

### Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?
The cover gives a general overview of my data. It highlights the location and type of surface detailed in each data entry. The center graph maps out the frequency of each mediums use by having each instance darker for each use. The back similarly displays the frequency of medium by displaying a density map. 

### What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something you didn't expect?
It does not offer anything extremely new to me. However, the frequency which I look at myself layed out in this manner is a little embarrasing. I did not notice how much I chose to look at myself. I hope it will make me rethink my actions in the future. 

### Did you make crucial compromises? Which ones?
Something I sorely wished to present did not make it into this project. I hoped to use the withCompany element to view trends when I looked at reflections in the company of other people. This would give me more information where I could then extrapolate a trend, consequence and subsequently indentify a solution (if the consequence is negative). 

### If this project had a larger scale and wasn't built for print, how would you imagine it to be?
If this project wasn't confined to a printed zine I would like to have a visualization that was organized in layers. This way I could present different facets of the data in one view frame instead of splitting components/categories into seperate graphs.
