### What data did you choose to collect?
I chose to collect data pertaining to each instance where I looked into a reflective surface. This included the time, location, medium and whether or not I was with company.

### How did you collect it, what was the routine?
This dataset was collected using a google form where I inputed string data. It was subsequently exported into a JSON file. 

### Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?

### What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something you didn't expect?

### Did you make crucial compromises? Which ones?

### If this project had a larger scale and wasn't built for print, how would you imagine it to be?
