Reply All's 'The Crime Machine' Podcast

Critical Questions for Big Data by Danah Boyd and Kate Crawford

Why does Bowker say "'Raw data is both and oxymoron and a bad idea'" ? (pp. 663)

What could be meant by the quote "'accounting tools [...] do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure'"? Try draw parallels to the CompStat system from the Reply All Podcast.

This quote notes the dual relationship between reality and data representations of reality. A simple example of this would be the stock market. Those who refer to data maps of the changing stock prices can in turn use that data to decide whether to sell, buy or hold. This creates a loop that prompts users to reshape reality based off of the 'reality' offered.
The CompStat system performs a similar loop. The system shows the crime statistics based on location and time. Then commanding officers use that data in turn to decide what type of crime to pursue, area to patrol and time to perform raids. This action sequence then impacts the current data being collected as specific crimes decrease or increase.

In which way is Twitter data limited?

Twitter's data is limited in that the company gives the impression of full access; however, every dataset offered does not include the 'full picture'. Instead, datasets are redacted. Private accounts' info are not included invalidating the claim that any analysis provides a complete picture of twitter's users.

If you don't need to login to obtain certain data, then it is public and free to use. Or isn't it? Please share your opinion.

I believe that 'public' data should be free for use; however, this use must be closely monitored and regulated. Government policies and legislation must catch up in order for individual persons and groups are protected under the law and therefore able to pursue legal action in violations of personal liberties. 

No prompts here, but a very well written chapter that is relevant to everything we will be talking about this semester. Please enjoy.
