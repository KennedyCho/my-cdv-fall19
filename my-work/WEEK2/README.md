Due this Wednesday (2019/09/11):

Create a Google Form collecting data of the "linear scale" type (like we did in this week's Lab)
collect responses from at least 10 people (e.g. send it to people in this class room (I can help distribute))
use the techniques used in the lab to
export the data in json format
transform it to an array with average values
build a bar graph using JavaScript (lab's code)
the last two points can be worked on simultaneously (you don't need all the responses to start working on the code)
