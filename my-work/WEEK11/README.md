Due Monday (2019/11/25):

Build your website.
Focus on the layout, all scrolling, paging, etc. that you envision for your final project, should be included.
Where D3 SVGs would go, put an empty <div></div> instead and assign CSS border: solid black 1px; (to make it visible).
Include all of the text that will be on your final website.
Push and submit a link to the class wiki.
For next class, be prepared to talk about your ideas.
