The idea of erasing information in order to forget reminds me of the "right to be forgotten". However, this instance changes the context where instead of the inidivual being forgotten it is a place. Additionally, this is done in order to protect not the location but future generations. As this idea relates to how erasure and memory can relate to data systems I am unsure.  

> Data-driven regimes repeat the racist, sexist, and oppresive policies of their antecendents beacuse the biases and attitudes have been encoded into them at the root. 

Systems that build upon the pre-existing faulty social hierarchies don't revise the inequalities that already exist instead they reinforce them. This rings quite similar to the idea of "digital poorhouses" where data-driven systems built within a society that already holds extreme predjudice agaisnt the poor are simply predicating the same ideas. 

> But perhaps the most obvious is that despite the sheer volume of information that exists online - the plurality of moderating views and alternative explanations - conspiracy theories and fundamentalism don't merely survive, they proliferate. 

The idea that mass quantities of publicly available information instigate well-informed public action is false. Conspiracy theories are a great example of this as they rely on circulation within non-mainstream groups until they break into the mainstream. Even when users encounter professionally vetted, accurate information there still is the idea of "fake news" that allows anyone to reject objective facts.
