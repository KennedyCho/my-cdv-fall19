Data Self-collection for this week's lab
Save the data you have collected thus far, the temporal data for the data zine in a json format.
push it to your GitHub and post the link to the class wiki.
if the data is sensitive and you don't want it online, please share it, or a description of it with me in an email (leon.eckert@nyu.edu).

Read the notes from the lab carefully.
Read them again, and email me questions you have. Book my office hours, too.
Use D3 to turn the dataset you are currently collecting (started after Week 2 class) into shapes.
Do not worry about visualizing the data effectively yet.
create any shapes from it and use data functions in at least one spot in way that the value of your data point affects the shape you created using D3.
push your work to your repo and submit a link to the class wiki by Wednesday (2019/09/18)
