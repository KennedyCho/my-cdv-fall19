Due this Wednesday (2019/10/23):

Take a deep dive into the datasets that you can find online.
Find three different datasets that you like, write a short paragraph highlighting what they are about and how you could imagine building a project around them.
collect those notes in markdown file, push to your repo and submit a link to the class wiki by Wednesday.
Find some sources for datasets in our Resource page.
if you find other cool sources (both english and chinese), consider submitting them to a collection I have started ðŸ˜Š
Dedicate time to this research, find something that you feel connected to and inspired by --> you will spend about five weeks dealing with the subject you choose, pick something exciting.
keep your mind open to the possibility of collecting or scraping an interesting dataset - if this is something of interest to you, I will assist and advise you.
